# ESP32 Bluetooth
A simple project aimed at testing the esp32 and creating a basic development enivronment

## Description
Im very interested in the ESP32 devices to the point where I'd like to start evaluating
what a development environment would look like them for me. Goals for this project is
to use vscode and a docker development environment to write code that:
- Sets up an MCU's bluetooth module to be discoverable
- Allow a PC to connect
- Transmit data from the PC over bluetooth to blink an onboard LED

## Development Environment

## MCU Application
### Build

## Desktop Application

## Usage

## Future work
